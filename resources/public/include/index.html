            Tim is a gifted developer - thoughtful, strategic, and careful. We hired him to develop the StoryDesk CloudEditor. He delivered a beautiful, one-of-a-kind HTML5 content management system for iPad. I offer Tim my highest recommendation, as a colleague and a friend.

            Tim is a strong Ruby and Rails developer, whom I worked with as a SCRUM Master on an operational data transformation and data store project. Tim was both proactive and balanced in his solutions from a business and technical standpoint, articulate, and was very effective in pair programming scenarios with different developers on the team. His attention to detail, adaptability and willingness to take on new challenges is further enhanced with his positive attitude. I would welcome working with Tim again and recommend him as a strong asset to any organization.

            Tim is one of the most intelligent, forward-thinking developers I've ever worked with. He possesses a deep pool of knowledge about all things related to software and uses that to engineer top-notch solutions. The diversity he's gained from experience with so many different languages and technologies gives him great perspective on technical approaches and strategies. He is also one of the most enthusiastic and proactive colleagues I've ever had the chance to work with, and I'm sure that he's up to any challenge that comes his way.
